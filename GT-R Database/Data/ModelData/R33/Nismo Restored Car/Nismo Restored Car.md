## What is a Nismo Restored Car?  
  
"Restoration defined by Nismo" goes beyond the general concept and methods of visually sprucing up, and instead is done according to a new concept that also includes "restoring performance in a visible way.”  
  
This is the only way that aims to bring vehicles in various conditions back to a certain level of performance of a particular vehicle when it was new. This can only be done by Nismo, by making use of various methods, techniques, equipment, facilities, and so on.  
  
This also makes a "Nismo restored car" a one-off for the owner, which maintains its brilliance and performance for decades to come.  
  
A Nismo Restored Car is available for R32 GT-R, R33 GT-R and R34 GT-R.  
  
## What is Restoration Defined by Nismo?  
  
__1. Body__  
* To guarantee overall performance, Nismo measure the torsional rigidity and dimensions of the body according to the Nismo standards based on the performance of the automobile manufacturer, and then make repairs to correct deterioration factors and maintain a good balance. After the deteriorated sealing is reapplied, the entire body is repainted in the requested colour.  
* Optional: Electrodeposited coating, melting sheet replacement  
  
__2. Engine__  
* After the engine is fully disassembled for overhaul and balancing, benchtop performance measurements and lapping are performed.  
* Optional: Upgrading to Nismo tuning specifications  
  
__Others, drive-line, braking system__  
* Operation check, inspection, disassembly and cleaning, overhaul, and replacement and painting of deteriorated parts.  
* Optional: Additional replacement of components in requested parts  
  
__3. Interior__  
* Cleaning  
* Optional: Replacement in consideration of total coordination of vehicle cabin using Nissan GT-R (R35) coverings, painting repair of plastic parts  
  
__Others, electrical system__  
* Continuity and operation check, inspection, and replacement of deteriorated parts.  
  
__4. Completion inspection__  
* After conducting thorough performance examination on a chassis dynamometer, test driving is done by a Nismo test driver or a professional driver.  
  
## Production Flow of a Nismo Restored Car  
  
__1. Complete disassembly__  
  
Restoration begins with complete disassembly of the car body.  
  
All parts including minor parts are removed in order to ascertain the condition of all parts and perform the optimum work in the following processes.  
  
__2. Body dimensions measurement and repair__  
  
As a general practice, the frame dimensions are accurately measured using the latest 3D measuring instrument.  
  
Corroded parts are repaired and, at the same time, the body is restored to proper condition.  
  
Then, panels are repaired to correct for the reduced body rigidity resulting from aging.  
  
This is optimum work that also considers corrosion by heat entering the panels that can only be done by Nismo, who has tuned Skyline GT-R cars to the ultimate and engaged in racing activities.  
  
__3. Paint removal and electrodeposited coating__  
  
It is also possible to perform optional paint removal and reapply the electrodeposited coating during the restoration process.  
  
The bare iron body free of any rust makes you feel the amazingness that creates new value.  
  
This is one of the special processes known only to the owner.  
  
__4. Body torsional rigidity measurement__  
  
This is the most important process of a Nismo restored car, for which Nismo proposes a new restoration method.  
  
This measurement determines the performance of the optimally repaired body in a comprehensive and visible way.  
  
Values at multiple measurement points are checked to see if there are any differences in the left/right balance, whether the rigidity value at the time of production is ensured, and whether the body exhibits appropriate flexibility.  
  
__5. Coating__  
  
This work starts with removing the sealing hardened due to aging deterioration and polishing the coating film of parts plated in the past.  
  
Then, after degreasing, the sealing is reapplied, and an undercoat that produces the equivalent effect to an electrodeposited coating is applied, followed by baking in an oven. Then after surfacer and putty are applied, the car proceeds to the final topcoat process.  
  
In the topcoat process, parts that are not painted on the factory line are also painted to achieve a quality and finish equivalent to that of show cars displayed by automobile manufacturers.  
  
Also, Nismo can reproduce the original color from a color sample from the time of original production, or you can choose to change the color to another color.  
  
__6. Engine (Disassembly/assembly)__  
  
Nismo, with experience assembling a large number of Skyline GT-R RB26DETT engines, performs overhauls in which the engine is reassembled with a precision higher than standard for automobile manufacturers.  
  
Just like the body, all parts are disassembled, cleaned, measured and inspected one by one.  
  
Then, consumable parts are replaced, followed by machining and correction according to the inspection results.  
  
Furthermore, supported by the know-how earned through many racing activities, you can also choose to have the engine reborn as a tuned engine.  
  
__7. Engine (Benchtop performance measurement)__  
  
The overhauled or tuned RB26DETT engine undergoes benchtop performance checks.  
  
In lapping under high & low load conditions between 2,400 to 6,000 rpm in 400 rpm increments, Nismo will check for problems in the control of each electrical part, and then for leaks in the cooling and hydraulic pathways.  
  
After these preparations have been completed, a boost check is performed, followed by performance checks at full throttle up to 6,800 rpm or 7,600 rpm in accordance with the specifications.  
  
As a result, the benchtop performance measurement data of each engine is recorded and managed by Nismo, and only engines that properly satisfy the output performance in the required range are finally delivered to the engine-mounting process.  
  
__8. Drive-line__  
  
Clutch, transmission, transfer, FR & FR propeller shaft, FR & FR differential, and four drive shafts of the drive train that transmit and control power output from the engine.  
  
Depending on the part, unit replacement with new parts, overhaul, or rebalancing is performed.  
  
__9. Chassis parts__  
  
There are a variety of finishings for chassis repairs.  
  
Replacement of rubber bushings and replacement and repainting of link arms.  
  
Replacement or inspection and measurement of shock absorbers and springs.  
  
Replacement or inspection and overhaul of brake line and caliper rotors, clutch line, fuel line and tanks, air conditioner, E-TS hydraulic unit extending from power steering pump, and cooling system components.  
  
Others include repainting and plating of brackets and stays, and replacement of minor parts such as nuts and bolts.  
  
__10. Electrical components__  
  
Just like chassis components, electrical parts are replaced with "Nismo Heritage Parts" for Skyline GT-R, born from the activity of remanufacturing genuine parts that were once discontinued, and they go through CPU operational checks and cleaning.  
  
Even the harnesses that must be carried over may have their couplers replaced depending on the degree of deterioration.  
  
__11. Interior__  
  
In order to create a Nismo restored car that restores performance in a visible way, the repair work also involves showing distinctive Nismo features in the interiors.  
  
Due to flame retardant standards, the fabrics at the time of production are not available.  
  
However, under supervision of a Nissan designer, in order to fully utilize the Skyline GT-R world perspective, Nismo propose upholstering using only the fabrics used in the Nissan GT-R (R35) for all parts.  
  
Nismo not only use fabrics not available on the market but also achieve a combination of coverings for comprehensively designed interiors.  
  
You can enjoy new value combined with painting repair of plastic parts.  
  
Of course, if you want to keep the car original, Nismo will only repair the parts by cleaning.  
  
__12. Test driving and completion__  
  
After all repairs have been completed, the car’s output is measured and checked for defects using a chassis dynamometer directly coupled to the car’s axle. After that, Nismo proceed to the final test driving.  
  
In test driving, Nismo assume 7 evaluation courses and check 12 items for road holding ability (steering feel, turning, stability, and roll feel) and 9 items for riding comfort (flatness, damping, shock magnitude, high-frequency vibration, and postural change). The Nismo test driver also performs noise evaluation of the suspension and power steering.  
  
These are checked to see if they are at the same level as when the car was new, which serves as proof that the car has been restored properly as a Nismo restored car.  
  
In addition, Nismo also record and present the history of continuation, replacement (including part numbers), inspections, recoating, etc., of all of the parts that constitute one vehicle.  
  
Then, the car is delivered to the owner.
